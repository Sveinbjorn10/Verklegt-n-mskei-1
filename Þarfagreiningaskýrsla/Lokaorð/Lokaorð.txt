This project gave us a new insight of how a good software can take a lot of
work. It was interesting how the design ideas can change after all interviews 
and how inportant it is to get users involved in the process, to see the flaws that
appeared in the project. Or else they whould have gone completely past us. 
Everybody took a part in this project and the teamwork was good.
